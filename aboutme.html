      <h1>About Me</h1
        <p>Hi, I'm Amy. I am 16 years old and going into my senior year of high school. 
          I am currently doing a program called Girls Who Code which is teaching me computer sciene as such. 
          A few things I really enjoy are playing volleyball, fashion, travelling and reading. 
          Some of my dislikes include pickles and rude people. </p>

        <p>Fun Fact: I used to be such a tomboy and still kind of am, it just doesn't look like it anymore. It still surprises my friends.</p>
